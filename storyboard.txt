GAME: "Is prompt engineering dead?" 

One input box:
Input your prompt, we will work our magic and return two responses, an original response and an optimized response.

Loading state while we work our magic

Two side-by-side columns, original response and optimized response, unlabeled (randomly ordered)
Your job is to determine which response is better, maybe give a score too?


Then we break down the analysis and optimization to show what we did. Highlighting portions of the 
    original prompt and the reasoning for the changes. Can we make this visual and animated?


THEN:

"See if you can generate a prompt that you prefer better than the one we generate"

repeat




Rewrite this poem in Shakespeare's style.

I'm going to the store to buy some eggs.
too bad inflation is so high.
2 eggs isn't enough
I need 100 eggs
small omelettes for breakfast I guess
